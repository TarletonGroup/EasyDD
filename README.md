# EasyDD

Dislocation plasticity simulations using explicitly calculated interactions. Based on [DDLab](http://micro.stanford.edu/wiki/Main_Page). 

## Requirements

- C/C++ compiler,
- CUDA compiler (optional),
- MATLAB (2019b+ preferred).

## Capabilities

- Cantilever bending,
- Pillar compression and extension,
- Nanoindentation,
- Inclusion-dislocation interaction.

## Folder structure

- input: contains inputs,
- output: contains outputs,
- scr: source files,
  - wip: contains folders for work in progress of the researches using the code,
- test: place for unit and integral tests,
- shadow_realm: compressed folder with old code kept around for posterity,
- publications: each publication is a folder containing the commit and any auxiliary code used to generate the publication.
